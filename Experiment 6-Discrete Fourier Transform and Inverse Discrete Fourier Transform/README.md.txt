Theory: 

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of discrete signals from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing analysis of frequency components. 
It represents the signal as a sum of complex exponentials, providing insights into its frequency content. 
The Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) reverses this process, reconstructing the original time-domain signal from its frequency-domain representation. 
Both DFT and IDFT are essential tools in digital signal processing, enabling efficient signal analysis and manipulation using algorithms like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
