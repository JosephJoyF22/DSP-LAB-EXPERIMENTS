Theory: Circular convolution combines two periodic signals to produce a third periodic signal, wrapping around at the boundaries.
Unlike linear convolution, it treats signals as periodic, making it especially useful in the frequency domain with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
This operation is essential in filtering and signal analysis, preserving periodic characteristics in the output.
