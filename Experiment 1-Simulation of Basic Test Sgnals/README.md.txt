Theory: 
Fundamental signals in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) are crucial for analyzing systems and representing complex signals.
1.	Unit Impulse Signal: Zero everywhere except at n=0, where it is 1. Used to test system responses.
2.	Unit Step Signal: 0 for n<0 and 1 for n≥0. Analyzes step responses and stability in systems.
3.	Ramp Signal: Increases linearly for n≥0. Represents constant growth or acceleration.
4.	Sine Wave: A periodic signal oscillating between positive and negative values, fundamental in signal decomposition.
5.	Cosine Wave: Similar to a sine wave but starts at its peak; phase-shifted by 90 degrees.
6.	Exponential Signal: Grows or decays exponentially, useful for modeling processes like population growth.
7.	Unipolar Pulse: A rectangular signal that is positive for a specific period and zero elsewhere.
8.	Bipolar Pulse: Rectangular signal that alternates between positive and negative values.
9.	Triangular Wave: A periodic signal that rises and falls linearly, forming a triangle shape.
