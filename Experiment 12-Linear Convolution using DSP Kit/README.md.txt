Linear Convolution Theory (TMS320C6748):

Linear convolution on TMS320C6748 implements y(n) = Î£ x(k)h(n-k), combining input signal x(n) with impulse 
response h(n). The kit's architecture optimizes this through parallel processing and dedicated multiply-accumulate
(MAC) operations. For input sequences of length M and N, output length is M+N-1. The process utilizes DSP's 
memory hierarchy and DMA controller for efficient data handling during computation.
