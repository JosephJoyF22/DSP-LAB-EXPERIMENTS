Sine Wave Theory (TMS320C6748)

Sine wave generation on TMS320C6748 involves digital synthesis using equation y(n) = A*sin(2Ï€fn/fs). The DSP kit 
uses lookup tables for efficient computation and phase accumulator for frequency control. Implementation leverages
the kit's McASP interface and DAC for converting digital samples to analog output. The process requires proper 
sampling frequency (typically 48kHz), phase increment calculation, and memory management for lookup tables.
