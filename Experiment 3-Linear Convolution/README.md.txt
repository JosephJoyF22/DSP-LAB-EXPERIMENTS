Theory: Linear convolution combines two signals to produce a third signal, representing the output of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. It involves sliding one signal over another, multiplying overlapping values, and summing them to form the output. This process is crucial in signal processing for analyzing system responses and implementing filtering techniques.
