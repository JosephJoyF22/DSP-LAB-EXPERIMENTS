Theory: The Sampling Theorem states that a continuous signal can be reconstructed from samples if sampled at a rate greater than twice its highest frequency (Nyquist rate). Verification involves sampling a signal at different rates: below (causing aliasing) and at or above (allowing accurate reconstruction), highlighting the importance of proper sampling rates.
