Theory: Linear convolution can be expressed in terms of circular convolution by zero-padding the signals to the same length, allowing for periodic extension. 
This technique enables the use of efficient algorithms like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to compute linear convolution in the frequency domain. 
Conversely, circular convolution can be interpreted as linear convolution when the signals are treated as periodic. 
This relationship is crucial for efficient processing in digital signal applications, enabling the manipulation of signals without losing important characteristics.
